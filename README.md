# React-Express Boilerplate

In the past, when I want to build a fullstack application, I would run two scripts - create-react-app and express-generator - to get a basic starting point for development. I found that I have wasted enough time deleting boilerplate code and not understanding webpack, so I have decided to spend a weekend building this boilerplate to help my development proceess going forward. 

Best of luck,
